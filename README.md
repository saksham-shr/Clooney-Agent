## ⚙️ Prerequisites

To run the Clooney Frontend Agent, you will need:

-   Node.js ≥ 18.0.0
-   npm or yarn
-   Git
-   OpenAI API Key (GPT-4o or newer recommended for best results)

```bash
node --version  # Must be ≥ v18.0.0
```

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd clooney-agent          # or the folder where the project lives
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Install Playwright browsers

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the project root.

```bash
touch .env
```

Add your OpenAI API key and optional configuration:

```ini
# Minimum required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here

# Optional – customize defaults
TARGET_URL=https://asana.com
OUTPUT_DIR=./output/asana-clone-frontend
BROWSER_TIMEOUT=90000
VIEWPORT_WIDTH=1920
VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=1080
```

> **Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file. It contains your secret API key.

## ▶️ Usage

### Clone a Website

Use the command line interface directly or the npm script:

```bash
# Recommended
node cli/clone.js https://example.com

# Or via npm script
npm run clone -- https://example.com
```

The agent will perform the following steps:

1.  Launch a browser and capture full-page screenshots + DOM.
2.  Analyze layout, components, styles, and design tokens.
3.  Send everything to OpenAI for code generation.
4.  Output a complete, ready-to-run Next.js + Tailwind + TypeScript project.

### Run the Generated Project

Navigate to the output directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd output/asana-clone-frontend   # or your custom OUTPUT_DIR
npm install
npm run dev                      # → http://localhost:3000
```

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

All final code is generated by an LLM (OpenAI API) after screenshot and DOM extraction.

Even the most advanced AI models in 2025 cannot perfectly clone complex, production-grade websites in a single pass. The generated project is an extremely strong starting point — usually achieving **70–90% visual and structural similarity** — but you should expect and plan for the following issues:

-   Missing or incorrect interactions (hover states, modals, forms, etc.)
-   Inaccurate responsive behavior on some breakpoints
-   Incomplete dynamic logic or state management
-   Subtle spacing, shadow, or typography differences
-   Non-functional animations or third-party integrations

**Manual review, debugging, and refinement are always required** before using the output in production.

> Think of Clooney as a powerful AI accelerator that gets you 80% of the way there in minutes instead of days — not a magical one-click perfect cloner.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
| :--- | :--- |
| Timeout errors | Increase `BROWSER_TIMEOUT` (e.g., `120000`) in your `.env` file. |
| OpenAI key errors | Double-check key in `.env`. Ensure there are no quotes or spaces around the key. |
| Playwright browser missing | Run `npx playwright install chromium` again. |
| Heap out of memory | Prepend the command with a memory increase: `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" node cli/clone.js ...` |
| Port 3000 already in use | Run `PORT=3001 npm run dev` in the generated project directory. |
